# Company Introduction:
---
Your client for this project is a Government Organisation.

 * The Department of Natural Resources Canada is the department of the Federal Government of Canada responsible for the management of natural resources, energy, minerals and metals, forests, earth sciences, and the environment.

 * Natural Resources Canada works to ensure the responsible development of Canada's natural resources, including energy, forests, minerals and metals. NRC also uses its expertise in environmental science to build and maintain a better atmosphere for the people of Canada. NRC uses different data to monitor the factors causing emissions of GreenHouse gases.

 * Canada's total GHG emissions in 2019 were 730 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2 eq), a slight increase from 728 Mt CO2 eq in 2018.

 * The major proportion of this data was emissions from personal vehicles.

## Current Scenario:
---
 * The more fuel your vehicle burns, the more greenhouse gases it produces, mostly in the form of carbon dioxide, or CO2. For every litre of gasoline your vehicle uses, it generates about 2.3 kilograms of CO2. Although not directly harmful to our health, CO2 emissions contribute to climate change.

 * It would be difficult to drive every model of the new vehicle on the road to measure fuel consumption and emission of Greenhouse Gases.

 * However, Designing a computer program can be helpful in this case.

 * Currently, the organisation is keeping track by manual inspection of each model launched by any manufacturing company.
